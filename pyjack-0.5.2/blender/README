 HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT
--------------------------


First, make sure you have sucessufully installed:
 - Blender (2.49)
 - PyJack
 - Jack


To enable this script in blender:
 - copy the script to ~/.blender/scripts
 - start blender
 - open a script window, and "update menus"
 - Select Misc -> "Jack Transport"


A new, small widget will appear:

s | < | > |   play   | x

 "s" will make transport to go 00:00;
 "<" and ">" will fast backwards forward;
 "play"/"pause" is obvious;
 "x" will stop the script


Enjoy!
